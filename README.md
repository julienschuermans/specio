# Spec.io

Built largely around the connexion library, a specification handling library that provides easy-to-use functions to convert or resolve Open API and Swagger contracts.
Loved and maintained by the Paperbox, a Belgian startup within the lovely Skyhaus Family.

## Disclaimer

This once-internal tool has now been open sourced and is still in its early feet. This library is currently focused on providing an easy way for Google Cloud Endpoints users to use `Open API 3.0` whilst pushing an auto generated `Swagger 2.0` to GCE all whilst maintaining just one contract.
That does not mean we won't develop new functionality, issues and pull requests are always welcome!
